# CS-230-Final-Project
#### CS-230 - Operating Platforms
Students will develop a deeper understanding of operating platforms and architectures through the analysis and evaluation of the characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses of each. Students will learn the value of utilizing software design templates as well as how to utilize them to solve problems.
## Scenario 
Working for Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) as a Technology Consultant I was assigned a client, The Gaming Room who currently has an application, Draw It or Lose It, that was created for Android Systems. The company wants to expand their reach into additional markets by changing to a web-based platform allowing for cross platform compatibility. My task was to develop a Software Design Template for the project. 
## Reflection Questions
###	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe that I did well at identifying the strengths and weaknesses of different platforms and correctly identifying which were the optimal choice for use in the scenario. 
###	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I found that taking the time to put my thoughts onto paper prior to writing code assisted in having a well-rounded understanding of the intent. This meant that I was able to mentally work through different approaches and assess if they were the best option or if I needed to redesign prior to getting attached to my code. 
###	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revisit the evaluation table. I feel I did an acceptable job for my current knowledge level but would like to do additional research, especially on Linux due to the number of options I am still unaware of that could be more tailored to the scenario than the ones I identified.
###	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
To interpret the user’s needs, I created user stories. This practice helped me to identify who would be using the system, what they wanted to do, and why so that way I could identify the best way I know to implement the requirement. This is important when designing a system because it is easy to accidentally design the system for yourself, when you need to think of what the user knows and what is important to them. As a non-technical person typically they may have different needs or expect features to function differently than the developer might think. 
###	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
The approach to designing this was working in small incremental steps. The first step was to understand who the customer was and what they needed. Once the requirements were understood I could focus on what constraints I had. Then came figuring out the architecture of the software and lastly determining what environment it would need to run in. Working though these increments allowed me to refine my analysis each stage and find realistic solutions.
