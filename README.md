# CS-230-Final-Project
#### CS-230 - Operating Platforms
Students will develop a deeper understanding of operating platforms and architectures through the analysis and evaluation of the characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses of each. Students will learn the value of utilizing software design templates as well as how to utilize them to solve problems.
## Scenario 
Working for Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) as a Technology Consultant I was assigned a client, The Gaming Room who currently has an application, Draw It or Lose It, that was created for Android Systems. The company wants to expand their reach into additional markets by changing to a web-based platform allowing for cross platform compatibility. My task was to develop a Software Design Template for the project.
